# spotify-bixby

There was no bixby integration to spotify (in Brazil) so I created mine. It's (currently) super simple, in the sense that more features *should* be added.

### Frontend

This is the Bixby part. It sends a request to the backend with the query, and receives a Spotify URI containing the item.

### Backend

The backend interacts with the Spotify API to search for the query terms.

### To-Do

1. Improve stability
2. Make it work with the screen locked
